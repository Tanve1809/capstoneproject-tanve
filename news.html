        <p>Climate change is one of the biggest global challenges that will shape the way we do business now and 
            in the coming decades. The Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, facilitated by the World Economic Forum, 
            believes the private sector has a responsibility to actively engage in global efforts to reduce 
            greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to help lead the global transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient 
            economy.
            <br> <br>
            The Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders is a global network of chief executive officers who see the business
            benefits of bold and proactive action to ensure a smooth transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient
            conomy. The group represents business leaders from diverse industry sectors and regions that use their 
            position and influence to drive change. This Alliance further seeks to catalyze and aggregate action and
            initiatives from companies from all industry sectors â€” towards delivering concrete climate solutions and
            innovations in their practices, operations and policies.
