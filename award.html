<p>This year, more than ever, the world needs leaders — people who go above and beyond to make the world a better
place; people who are focused on supporting the most vulnerable communities; people who inspire you to stand up and
take action.
The Global Citizen Prize honors the leaders among us who are making extraordinary efforts for the world’s most
vulnerable. This broadcast and digitally streamed show will also feature inspirational stories and unforgettable
performances that will bring together influencers, artists, activists, and global leaders to remind each of us 
that, together, we will come out of this year stronger.
