        <p>Climate change poses an urgent threat. While the global community has been working on climate action
           for over thirty years, the pace of progress has been unacceptably slow. The world needs to adopt a new
           paradigm that catalyses industry sectors to take action. Public and private collaboration is essential to dramatically reduce emissions and spur transformative change.
            <br><br>
            ​​In this decisive decade for climate action, the Climate Ambition Team of the World Economic Forum has
            been established to deliver a net-zero economy.
            <br><br>
            Climate Ambition Initiatives provide a global platform to raise ambition and accelerate climate action 
            through multi-stakeholder partnerships.
