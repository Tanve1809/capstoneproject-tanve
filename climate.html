        <h2>What are climate changes??</h2>
        <p>Climate change refers to the change in the environmental conditions of the earth. This happens due to many internal and external factors. The climatic change has become a global concern over 
            the last few decades. Besides, these climatic changes affect life on the earth in various ways. These climatic changes are having various impacts on the ecosystem and ecology. Due to these
             changes, a number of species of plants and animals have gone extinct.The climate started changing a long time ago due to human activities but we came to know about it in the last century. 
             During the last century, we started noticing the climatic change and its effect on human life. We started researching on climate change and came to know that the earth temperature is 
             rising due to a phenomenon called the greenhouse effect.
             The warming up of earth surface causes many ozone depletion, affect our agriculture, water supply, transportation, and several other problems.</p>

             <h2>Reason Of Climate Change</h2>
             <br>
             <br>
             <p><b>Natural Reasons</b> 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                These include volcanic eruption, solar radiation, tectonic plate movement, orbital variations. Due to these activities, the geographical condition of an area become quite harmful for life to survive. Also, these activities raise the temperature of the earth to a great extent causing an imbalance in nature.</p>

                    <br>
                    Man due to his need and greed has done many activities that not only harm the environment but himself too. Many plant and animal species go extinct due to human activity. Human activities that harm the climate include deforestation, using fossil fuel, industrial waste, a different type of pollution and many more. All these things damage the climate and ecosystem very badly. And many species of animals and birds got extinct or on a verge of extinction due to hunting.</p>
