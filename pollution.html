    <h1>Pollution</h1>
        <p>Pollution is when gases, smoke and chemicals are introduced into the environment in large doses that
            makes it harmful for humans, animals and plants. Some forms of pollution can be seen, some are invisible.
            <br> <br>
            Our Earth has an atmosphere that’s made up of different gases. The amount of gases on our atmosphere is 
            just right to encourage life on our planet. We breathe the air and we thrive on it. Because of our 
            advances in technology, we are introducing new chemicals into our atmosphere, causing an imbalance. 
            The most popular effect of this imbalance in nature is Global Warming.

        <h2>Pollution Issues</h2>

        <p>Air pollution is a mix of particles and gases that can reach harmful concentrations both outside and 
            indoors. Its effects can range from higher disease risks to rising temperatures. Soot, smoke, mold, 
            pollen, methane, and carbon dioxide are a just few examples of common pollutants.
            <br><br>
            Poor air quality kills people. Worldwide, bad outdoor air caused an estimated 4.2 million premature
            deaths in 2016, about 90 percent of them in low- and middle-income countries, according to the World
            Health Organization. Indoor smoke is an ongoing health threat to the 3 billion people who cook and
            heat their homes by burning biomass, kerosene, and coal. Air pollution has been linked to higher 
            rates of cancer, heart disease, stroke, and respiratory diseases such as asthma. In the U.S. nearly
            134 million people—over 40 percent of the population—are at risk of disease and premature death 
            because of air pollution, according to American Lung Association estimates.

        <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
        <p>Water pollution occurs when unwanted materials enter in to water, changes the quality of water and harmful
        to environment and human health. Water is an important natural resource used for drinking and other
        developmental purposes in our lives. Safe drinking water is necessary for human health all over the world.
        Being a universal solvent, water is a major source of infection. According to world health organization (WHO)
        80% diseases are water borne. Drinking water in various countries does not meet WHO standards. 3.1% deaths
        occur due to the unhygienic and poor quality of water.
        <br> <br>
        Discharge of domestic and industrial effluent wastes, leakage from water tanks, marine dumping, radioactive
         waste and atmospheric deposition are major causes of water pollution. Heavy metals that disposed off and 
         industrial waste can accumulate in lakes and river, proving harmful to humans and animals. Toxins in industrial 
         waste are the major cause of immune suppression, reproductive failure and acute poisoning. Infectious diseases,
        like cholera, typhoid fever and other diseases gastroenteritis, diarrhea, vomiting, skin and kidney problem are
        spreading through polluted water. Human health is affected by the direct damage of plants and animal nutrition.
        Water pollutants are killing sea weeds, mollusks, marine birds, fishes, crustaceans and other sea organisms that 
        erve as food for human. Insecticides like DDT concentration is increasing along the food chain. These insecticides
        re harmful for humans.
